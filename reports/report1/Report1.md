## TODO: Description of the problem

## TODO: Pseudocode of all implemented algorithms

## TODO: Results of a computational experiment: for each instance and method min, max and average value of the objective function

## TODO: 2D visualization of the best solution for each instance and method. Cost of nodes should be presented e.g. by a color, greyscale, or size

## TODO: The best solutions for each instance and method presented as a list of nodes indices (starting  from 0)

## TODO: Information whether the best solutions have been checked with the solution checker
